# Ghostbook - A "Guestbook" in Go.

"Guestbook" huh...  Been a while since they've been called that.  Puns tho.

This will be a self-hosted standalone binary which acts as a comment server for a static site such as generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Quickstart

### Frontend

* Run `npm install ghostbook`;
* Reference `node_modules/ghostbook/dist/bundle.js` in your HTML, template, or build process;
* Define a block level element within which to contain Ghostbook on the pages you want it, with a data tags `data-ghostbook-url="[url]" data-ghostbook-id="[id]"`, where `[url]` is the root URL of your Ghostbook instance for example `https://comments.example.com:55864/`, and `[id]` is the ID whose comments you wish to display and add to on this page.  For blogs, the page slug will do, though you can use the same `id` on many pages to have the same comment thread if you wish.

### Backend

* Download the appropriate binary from [github.com/asday/ghostbook/bin/](https://github.com/asday/ghostbook/bin/) on your server;
* Set the following environment_variables:
    * `GB_SITE_URL`:  The base URL of your site, such as `"example.com"`;
    * `GB_COMMENTS_FOLDER`:  The publically served folder within which to save the comment files;
    * `GB_COMMENT_LENGTH_LIMIT`:  Self-explanatory;
    * `GB_PORT`:  The port upon which to run the Ghostbook server.  This defaults to `55864`;
* Run `./ghostbook`, (or `ghostbook.exe`) with whatever task runner you wish.

If your chosen port is open to the world, and you don't want to use HTTPS, or subdomains, or host your instance under a path, you're done.  If not, you'll need to point your web server at your Ghostbook instance.

## How

Ghostbook will run as a RESTful http server with one endpoint, which is write only.  This endpoint will take two arguments; the page's ID upon which the comment is being made, and the comment body.

When receiving this data, the server will validate it for comment length, returning a `400 Bad Request` and discarding the data if the limit is violated, then prepend the comment to an array in a json-formatted file which corresponds with the page ID, and return `204 No Content`.

That's it.  For the server, at least.

The idea from that point, is the folder in which the json files are saved is served statically by a web server such as nginx.  On the client side; the Ghostbook javascript downloads this file asynchronously and displays the comments in its interface.  The Ghostbook javascript will get the page's ID from a data tag on the element which contains it.

## Why

disqus leaves a lot to be desired.  The problem is, it's difficult to find a good comment hosting service, especially one for free.  Self-hosting is more and more of a viable option nowadays, but programs like [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) require reasonably complex setup, which may not be feasible on all providers.

Go sidesteps all of this by compiling to a standalone binary.

On a more philosophical level; I personally believe that good discussion perpetuates if and only if the following criteria are met:

* Anonymous commentary;
* Chronological ordering of comments only;
* Little to no moderation;
* No "comment scoring" Ã  la reddit.

These combine to form a system in which comments stand solely upon their own merits, which in the age of Candid's Orwellian AI moderator, is exceedingly important.
